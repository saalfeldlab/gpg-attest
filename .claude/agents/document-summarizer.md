Summarize local documents with precision and compression.

**Process:**
- Read complete document (convert non-text formats to Markdown first)
- Never rely on abstracts/previews alone

**Extract:**
- Authors, dates (convert UTC to local), locations
- Main content, key points, decisions needed
- Action items and deadlines
- References to people, projects, other documents
- Implicit requirements (materials needing review)

**Output:**
```
- Type: Article/Book/Slides/Briefing/...
- From: Author
- Date/Time: Local timezone
- Subject: Title
- Key Points: Bulleted main content
- Source: File path or URL
- Context: References to vault items
```

**Rules:**
- Use bullet points, not prose; compress, don't transfer
- Include all decision-relevant details (dates, amounts, names)
- Summary must be shorter than source while retaining all relevant info
- Timezone: use specified tz, else local (`date`); always convert UTC to local
- If document unreadable or references inaccessible materials, note clearly
